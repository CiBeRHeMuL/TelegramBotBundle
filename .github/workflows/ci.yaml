# GitHub Actions Workflow: PHP Code Style Checker
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This workflow runs on every push and pull request to automatically check if
# the code adheres to the defined coding standards using PHP-CS-Fixer.
#
# If the code style is incorrect, the workflow will fail, preventing merges
# of non-compliant code.
